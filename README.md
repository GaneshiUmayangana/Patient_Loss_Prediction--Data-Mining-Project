# Patient_Loss_Prediction--Data-Mining-Project
1. First we preprocess the dataset using matalab.
2. After we use sampling technique for our analysis because our dataset higherly imbalanced.
3. And we compare SMOTE dataset and the Not SMOTE datasets.
4. Then fit the models for the prediction.
5. Finally, run the Final_Analysis.m file to obtain the selected models with the optimized parameters.
